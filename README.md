# Local Step Functions
This repository contains an [ASL Workflow Engine](asl-workflow-engine) that provides a Local Step Function implementation exposing the AWS Step Function API and supporting AWS CLI and SDK calls.

In addition to the ASL Workflow Engine this repository provides a GUI for creating Step Functions in the form of a [drawio](drawio) Docker image bundled with the https://github.com/sakazuki/step-functions-draw.io Step Functions Plugin.

The repository also contains links to a range of [useful resources](useful_resources.md) about the Amazon States Language (ASL), including GUIs and possibilities for calling out to alternate serveless frameworks such as Fn or OpenFaaS or whatever.
