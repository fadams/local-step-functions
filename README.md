# Local Step Functions
This repository is about art of the possible in terms of running AWS Step Functions/Amazon States Language locally. The repository contains a range of links to resources about ASL including GUIs and possibilities for calling out to alternate serveless frameworks such as Fn or OpenFaaS or whatever.

For a (work in progress) implementation of ASL see the [ASL Workflow Engine](asl-workflow-engine) in this repository.
